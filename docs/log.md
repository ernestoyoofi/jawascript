# Syntax Log & Debugging

Quite simple, where you usually use the console to view some of the data, here you can also but only provide 2, namely :

- infoPerkoro : `console.error`
- catetan : `console.log`

```js
infoPerkoro("Error!")
// become as
console.error("Error!")
```
And

```js
catetan("Yeaa!")
// become as
console.log("Yeaa!")
```
