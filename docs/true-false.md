# Syntax True & False

> This section still has a lot of improvements, although I don't know when it will be fixed.

You can use several types, here are two, just use one of them :

- `iyo` mean `true`
- `nggih` mean `true`
- `ora` mean `false`
- `mboten` mean `false`

For the example :

```js
konstan isData iku iyo
// become as
const isData = true
```
